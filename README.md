# Aim Trainer

## Overview

Aim Trainer is a Unity-based 3D game designed to help players improve their aiming skills. In this game, players aim at and click on red dots that appear randomly on a wall. The red dots will disappear upon being clicked and reappear at a different location after a short delay, providing a dynamic and challenging environment for players to sharpen their aim.

## Features

- **3D Environment**: A simple 3D room with walls where red dots and enemies appear.
- **Red Dots**: Clickable red dots that spawn at random positions on a specified wall. The red dots can also strafe if the strafing option is enabled.
- **Enemies**: Spawning enemies that move around the environment and can also strafe. On higher difficulties, enemies will also jump, adding complexity to the gameplay.
- **Player Look**: Use the mouse to look around and aim.
- **Shooting**: Press the "Enter" key to interact with the red dots and enemies.
- **Strafing Mechanics**: Both the red dots and enemies can strafe (move side-to-side) if the strafing option is enabled. The strafing speed and duration vary, providing an additional layer of difficulty.
- **Difficulty Settings**: Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty levels that adjust the behavior of red dots and enemies, including how often they strafe or jump.
- **Realistic Weapon Handling**: The game features a player model holding a gun, modeled and rigged in Blender, that points accurately at the targets.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: Game engine used for developing the game.
- **C#**: Programming language used for scripting in Unity.
- **.NET**: Framework used to run C# scripts.
- **Blender**: 3D modeling software used for creating and rigging the gun model and player hand models.
